important
[x] doubleclick to exit load profile screen doesn't work
[x] cycle display is not correct yet for vertical mode
[x] make any direct pin access code portable
[ ] fix bounds limits on settings (fan at -300%? lol)
    [x] negative bounds fixed at 0%.
    [ ] need to implement bounds limits between previously set values in profile editor
    [ ] need to set sane upper limits on most settings
[x] Show which profile is loaded, and load selected profile by default
    note: last profile was already loaded by default. just added the display.
[x] Remove reliance on TimerThree in fake mode as mini and nano do not have timer3
[ ] Show time remaining for each timed process step (soak, peak)

low priority
[x] fix text leaving crap behind when redrawn, stale text after canceling load/save profile
[x] fix editing numeric values leaves crap behind if number of characters changes
[x] be more descriptive on how to exit menus (nothing is shown right now, you just have to know)
[ ] implement action selection on spare D5 and maybe D10 pin
    example: when to perform: after soak, after ramp up, etc:
             what to perform: go high, go low, pulse/hold for X seconds, etc
             data to perform: time to hold, delay to go high/low, etc
    why? beeper at action changes, beeper when done, solenoid when done to open door, etc
[x] reduce size to fit on a micro again
[/] Log (and show) completed and canceled run count with the oven, overall elapsed time run (aging?)
[ ] Rework ST7735 module - KP's is bigger than Adafruit's when compiled?
    update 20141027: it's because he has inlined everything.
[x] add eeprom checksum for firstrun support, rather than the weirdass read code that exists now
[/] replacing FP math with integer math where possible to save flash space
[ ] replace graph drawing routine drawPixel with drawLine
[ ] 

optional
[ ] look into adding scrollbar, and maybe a scroll area border
[ ] show stats/graph/divergence/something of previous run in lower area OR extend menus to fit LCD
[ ] add temperature calibration / offset (is this even necessary?)
[ ] find out how kp gets his code to even fit in a pro micro (it doesn't for me and he did not answer)
[?] wonder why I am fighting with such a small platform and limitations of arduino for this
[ ] add inverted color support
